`virtualenv .env && source .env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt`

And replace `.env/Lib/site-packages/pyscbwrapper/scb.py` with `scb.py` (from root repozitory directory).

Then activate the environment by typing `.env/Scripts/activate` in terminal, and on the bottom-right of VSCode you can select this environment for running this app.
